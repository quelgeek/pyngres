# Pyngres

Pyngres is a Python wrapper for the Actian Ingres OpenAPI.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pyngres.

```bash
pip install pyngres
```

(Note for **Conda** and **Miniconda** users: there is an as-yet undiagnosed problem that prevents **pip** from properly resolving the dependency on **loguru**. As a workaround install loguru before installing pyngres.)

## Usage

The pyngres package contains three modules. The pyngres module is a set of
Python bindings for the Actian OpenAPI. Anyone familiar with the OpenAPI and
with Python programming will find their expertise using the OpenAPI in C is 
directly transferable.

```python
import pyngres as ii
```

### pyngres.asyncio

The OpenAPI is intrinsically asynchronous. The API sends a request to a 
server and then returns to the caller without waiting for the request to 
be completed. It is up to the programmer to insert calls to IIapiWait() 
to pass control back to the API so that it can set the gp_completed flag 
and invoke any callback routine that was requested.

The Python asyncio package provides design patterns and a well-known
infrastructure that make asynchronous programming more convenient and support
concurrent execution. The asyncio package facilitates the development of 
highly responsive event driven applications, such as GUI applications.

The pyngres.asyncio package can be used in place of the bare-bones pyngres
package. It supports all the same entry points, but all the asynchronous 
OpenAPI functions are awaitable. They are executed in the asyncio event loop
concurrently with any other awaitables. (The one exception is the IIapi_await()
function which does not exist in pyngres.asyncio; it would serve no purpose.)

```python
import pyngres.asyncio as ii
```

### pyngres.blocking

OpenAPI applications that have no need to cooperate with other asyncio 
packages can use the pyngres.blocking package. It is functionally identical
to the base pyngres package except that all the of the OpenAPI functions 
block until completion in a platform independent way. This slightly reduces
the visual clutter of hard-coded loops calling IIapi_wait(), and eliminates
the risk of omitting a necessary wait loop. 

The pyngres.blocking package includes a null
implementation of IIapi_wait() so that pyngres.blocking can simply be
substituted for pyngres in an existing application without requiring 
any changes. 

```python
import pyngres.blocking as ii
```

**Linux:** initialize your Ingres environment by executing **~/.ing**XX**sh**, where XX
is your installation identifier (usually **II**). Example:

```
. ~/.ingIIsh
```

**Windows:** your Ingres installation will usually be initialized already.

Set the `IIAPI_DEV_MODE` environment variable or call `loguru.enable('pyngres')` in your application code to start pyngres API tracing using [Loguru](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
